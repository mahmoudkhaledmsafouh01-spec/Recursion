## How to run the merge sort demo

You can run the sample merge sort tests with either Node.js directly or via npm:

- **Node.js:** `node merge-sort/index.js`
- **npm script:** `npm run merge-sort`

Both commands execute `merge-sort/index.js`, which imports the implementation in `merge-sort/mergeSort.js` and logs several test cases to the console.
